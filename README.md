# No-Reference Physics-Based Quality Assessment of Polarization Images and its Application to Demosaicking. IEEE TIP 2021

## Content Description
- Code:
	- demo.m : demo.m : Run this code to see how to call the function that calculate the APMR criterion and predict the quality of the example input polarizaiton images by adding Gaussian noise.
	- APMR_compute.m : Function for computing the APMR criterion.
	- example.mat : An example of ideal input polarization images for testing the code.
